# solidity-lottery-contract

I have created a contract applied to a Lottery.

This Lottery contract provides a basic framework for a lottery system on Ethereum. By understanding its features, functionalities, and technical considerations, developers can use it as a foundation for building more complex and secure lottery applications such as simple lottery games or raffles on the Ethereum blockchain as well as it can be integrated into dApps or websites to provide lottery functionality to users.
